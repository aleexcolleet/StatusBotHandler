Project: [MICRO_SERV_V3]

- Receive .env variables (api, chatID)

- Receive the URLS from a JSON file
- Store them in-memory and in JSON file. This way JSON is used as a repo(database)
        so, I have two types of repos:
            - in-Memory
            - Json

Steps in my program:
    1. Inject .env variables
         a). Api telegram
         b). Chat telegram
         c). Ruta Json (URLS)
         d). If i had postgres or SQL(which are database) if I were using them

    2. Create repositories (the most atomic part of the capes of my program)
        a).IN-MEMORY
        b).Json File


Corrections:
- Telegram and HTTP are not a repos
